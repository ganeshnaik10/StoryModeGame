Today marks the first day of development for my story mode horror game.

I've started by creating the ground, which will serve as the foundation for the environment. 

This is just the beginning, and there's a lot more to come as I build the eerie and immersive world that will bring this game to life.

Stay tuned for more updates as I continue to develop and refine the game's environment, characters, and story elements. Your support and feedback are invaluable to me throughout this journey!
