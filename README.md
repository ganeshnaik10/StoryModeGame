For my final year BSc IT project, I embarked on the ambitious task of developing an immersive story mode game using C++. 
The game, set in a richly detailed fantasy world, follows the journey of a young hero destined to save their homeland from an ancient evil. 
With a focus on narrative-driven gameplay, the project aims to blend engaging storytelling with dynamic gameplay mechanics, including combat, exploration, and puzzle-solving.
By leveraging the powerful capabilities of c++, I was able to create visually stunning environments and lifelike character animations that enhance the player's immersion.
This project not only demonstrates my technical proficiency in game development but also my passion for creating captivating gaming experiences that resonate with players.
