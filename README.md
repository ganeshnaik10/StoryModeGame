Today marks the first day of development for my story mode horror game.

I've started by creating the ground, which will serve as the foundation for the environment. 

To bring more realism and depth to the scene, I've also added textures to the ground.

This is just the beginning, and there's a lot more to come as I build the eerie and immersive world that will bring this game to life.

Your feedback and support are invaluable as I progress through this journey.
